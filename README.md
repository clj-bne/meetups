## Clojure Brisbane

Meetups for the Clojure Brisbane group. http://www.meetup.com/clj-bne/

## Meetup ideas

Got an idea for a presentation or lightning talk? Great - [open an issue](https://github.com/clj-bne/meetups/issues) and present it next meetup.

Like someone's idea and want to hear it next? Then +1 away!

## Decks & Notes

We want to publish any supporting notes, code, slide decks, photos or videos you may have from our meetups. So if you've got anything you'd like to share, just fork this repo, add your material to the appropriate folder pull away (pull request that is).  Also, to keep things neat and tidy, try using branch names like 2013-10-29 so it's clear what meetup it is for.
